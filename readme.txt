Custom post meta field and meta box to set a caption for the featured image of a post.

== Description ==

Featured Image Caption is a WordPress plugin that creates a custom post meta field and meta box to set a caption for the featured image of a post. This data is saved to the post meta, and can be added to your theme using a function.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `featured-image-caption` directory to your site's `plugins` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Add the following line to your theme files (within The Loop) to display the caption: `<?php cc_featured_image_caption(); ?>`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set the caption for the featured image? =
The meta box is added in the side column of the Edit Post or Edit Page screen. Add your caption inside the text area within the meta box.

= Are there any options for this plugin? =
There aren't any options for this plugin. When you activate it, the meta box and theme function are added.

= How do I customize the formatting of the caption? =
The caption is contained inside a `<span>` tag with the class `cc-featured-image-caption` which you can use to apply CSS to the caption.

The image source attribution information is encapsulated in a separate `<span>` tag with the class `cc-featured-image-caption-source`.

Note: if you add the argument to return the caption, only the caption text is returned and is not encapsulated by `<span>` tags.

= How do I return the value of the caption without displaying it? =
The `cc_featured_image_caption()` function accepts an argument to determine whether the result is displayed or returned.

To return the value, use the following syntax: `cc_featured_image_caption( false );`

= How do I prevent source attribution data from being included with my caption request, even if the data is set for the post? =
The theme function accepts two arguments. The first handles whether to display the caption or return it, which is covered above. The second controls whether source attribution data is included. It defaults to `true`, meaning attribution data is included. If you set it to `false`, this data will not be included.

= Is there an easy way for me to check whether a caption has been set in my theme code? =
Use the function `cc_has_featured_image_caption()` to find out whether a caption is set. This function returns `true` if one is set, and `false` if no caption is set.
